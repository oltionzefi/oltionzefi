- 👋 Hi, I’m @oltionzefi
- 👀 I’m interested in reading books and finishing projects which I already did start :blush:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nodejs & developing in nodejs, mostly with NestJS. Always with TypeScript.
- 💞️ What I’m looking for? In these moments, I can think just enjoying different types of food.
- 📫 How to reach me? 💡 I have no idea how, but if you find how, you can reach me for sure.
